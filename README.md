# SageMaker Studio, Delta Lake, and MLflow Series

## Overview
This repository contains a workshop series demonstrating the integration of **Delta Lake** and **MLflow** with **AWS SageMaker Studio**. It covers key workflows such as using Delta Lake for data management and applying MLflow for experiment tracking, model management, and deployment within the SageMaker environment.

## Contents
- **01a-Delta Lake Workshop - Delta Lake Primer.ipynb**: Introduction to Delta Lake, its architecture, and how it integrates with data workflows.
- **01b-Delta Lake Workshop - SageMaker Models.ipynb**: How to leverage SageMaker models with Delta Lake and manage experiments using MLflow.
- **helper/**: Contains utility scripts for the workshop.
- **img/**: Contains images and diagrams for the notebooks.

## Requirements
- **AWS SageMaker Studio**
- **Delta Lake**
- **MLflow**
- **Python 3.x**

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
